    <h3 class="job"><span class="who"><a href="http://dmgroupk12.com">District Management Group</a></span>, <span class="where">Boston, MA</span> &mdash; <span class="when">July 2014&ndash;March 2020</span></h3>
    <p>DMGroup works with public school districts to implement best practices in scheduling and resource management. As part of the technology services team, I built and maintained Ember.js applications and Ruby on Rails sites and APIs to support elementary school master scheduling, a first-of-it's-kind software service; staff scheduling for special education; and a "schedule sharing" tool which produced aggregate analysis of practitioner-submitted schedules to give district leaders clarity about what their staff was doing.</p>
    <p>In addition to our customer-facing work, I led DMGroup's effort to <a href="https://github.com/dmcouncil/">release some of our internal tools</a> as open-source plugins for Ember and gems for Rails.</p>
    <h3 class="job"><span class="who"><a href="http://bqsoft.com">BeQuick Software</a></span>, <span class="where">Palm Beach Gardens, FL</span> &mdash; <span class="when">January&ndash;June 2014</span></h3>
    <p>BeQuick produces hosted billing solutions for operators of virtual mobile networks (MVNOs). I worked remotely as an Ember.js developer on two components of their next-generation HTML5 solution, built with Coffeescript and Grunt, and interfaced both with the rest of the Ember team and with the team building the Rails API backing the Ember apps.</p>

    <p>Co-founder of web production company specializing in Ruby on Rails and Drupal production. As technical lead, I followed through on execution of projects from server set-up to browser-side page-load optimization.

    <p>As Media Coordinator for this college textbook publisher, I moved a number of textbook ancillary sites from shared hosting to a co-located server owned by the publisher. I overhauled a number of flat-HTML sites to database-driven dynamic sites using PHP, and customized a rudimentary set of Javascript tools to drive ancillary CD-ROMs. As de-facto desktop support, updated workstations for more than 25 employees economically and unobtrusively, while supporting desktop applications and workplace internet applications such as e-mail and intranet.</p>
