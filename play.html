I run quite a bit, when I'm healthy, and relatively fast in   comparison to many people who run nowadays. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.nyrrc.org">New   York Road Runners</a>, <a href="http://www.usatf.org/">USATF</a>, and the <a href="http://storm.cadcam.iupui.edu/drs/drs.html">Dead   Runner's Society</a>.</p><p>I'll put up a race record   one of these days, but I've won seven (mostly small) races in 2002 and taken second   in four more. Yes, I've run marathons: started five, finished three. (Marathons   aren't easy, no matter what Team in Training tries to sell you.) I did <a href="http://www.mainemarathon.org/">Maine   '98</a>, <a href="http://www.marinemarathon.com/">Marine Corps '98</a>, <a href="http://www.columbusmarathon.com/">Columbus   '99 </a>, <a href="http://www.bostonmarathon.org/">Boston 2000</a> and <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/results/02/ma/Oct20_14thAn_1_set1.shtml">Baystate   2002</a>. You decide which I finished! One day I'll put a database of race reports   online so you can read where I've run and what I thought of it.</p><p>I was the online editor for <i><a href="http://www.runnersworld.com">Runner's   World</a> </i>for five years, from 1996 to 2001. I started writing about running   while I was there, and since then I've been published in RW, <i><a href="http://www.runningtimes.com">Running   Times</a></i>, <i><a href="http://www.nerunner.com">New England Runner</a></i>,   and several websites including <a href="http://www.fast-women.com">fast-women.com</a>,   <a href="http://www.mensracing.com">mensracing.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.nycmarathon.org">nycmarathon.org</a>.   You can find a collection of links to those articles <a href="/clips.php">on   the clips page</a>.</p><p><a href="/about.html">about this site</a> </p></body></html>
