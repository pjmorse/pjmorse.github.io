<h1>Email security for Cobalt servers</h1> <h2>How to protect your RaQ or Qube from spam and malicious email-borne code</h2> 
<p>
	The volume of both Unsolicited Commercial Email and Unsolicited Bulk Email (UCE and UBE, collectively known as &quot;spam&quot;) and email-borne virii, worms, and trojans (&quot;<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/malmobcode/">malicious mobile code</a>&quot;) is increasing daily. Together, they rob a system administrator's time, system resouces, and threaten to overwhelm the productive uses of electronic mail as a communications medium.
</p>
<p>
	This document is intended as a step-by-step guide to help users of <a href="http://www.cobalt.com/">Sun Cobalt</a> systems configure the installed sendmail and procmail packages to reject spam through the use of the access control database and DNS block lists, and to filter incoming email messages for malicious code.
</p>
<p>
	It is based primarily on my own work on a Qube3, and on input from others (often cited individually by their contributions) on the <a href="http://list.cobalt.com/mailman/listinfo/cobalt-users/">cobalt-users</a> and <a href="http://list.cobalt.com/mailman/listinfo/cobalt-security/">cobalt-security</a> lists. If you find something here which doesn't work for your system, please let me know which part doesn't work and what system you use. At the very least, we can add comments about which parts don't work!
</p>
<p>
	There are two commonly-used methods for stopping unwanted email: <b>blocking</b> at the MTA level (sendmail, on most Cobalts) and <b>filtering</b> at the MDA and MUA level (which means something based in procmail, the MDA for Cobalts.) Blocking can be accomplished with your local access control database and the use of DNS Block Lists. Filtering requires the installation of procmail-invoked programs like The Sanitizer, SpamAssassin or SpamBouncer, and configuring your users' Mail User Agents (MUAs) to take advantage of them. And before you even think about stopping incoming mail, you have to make sure your system isn't being exploited by spammers relaying their <i>outgoing</i> mail!
</p>
<p>
	I have detailed here a specific set of methods for reducing your server's spam load. It may not be the best choice for <i>your</i> situation. Before you put any of these methods into use on a production server, I strongly encourage you to read the &quot;<a href="alternatives.html">alternative approaches and other links</a>&quot; page, especially Philip Jacob's essay on &quot;<a href="http://theory.whirlycott.com/~phil/antispam/rbl-bad/rbl-bad.html">The spam problem: moving beyond RBLs</a>.&quot;
</p>
<p>
	Here are the steps you need to take:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Secure your system against open relaying 
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="access_db.html">Get familiar with the access control database</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="dnsbl.html">Start using DNS block lists</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="procmail.html">Install a procmail filter</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You will find these steps very challenging if you aren't familiar with using the Linux command line. Before you even get started, you should install SSH and turn off Telnet (see <a href="http://www.average.org/cobalt/quick-security-guide.html">Eugene Crosser's security checklist</a>) and learn to log in to a shell and make yourself root. You can find <a href="http://www.imb-jena.de/misc/unix">a quick guide to common unix commands</a> and tutorials for three common editors online: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/index.html">emacs</a>, <a href="http://docs.FreeBSD.org/44doc/usd/12.vi/paper.html">vi</a> and <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/joe.html">joe</a>; these come in handy when editing configuration files.

	<a href="http://www.habeas.com/index.htm">Haebas</a> is taking an interesting approach by attaching custom headers for bypassing spam filters; they then license these headers to companies (and, for free, to individuals) with hefty fines if the license if violated. Essentially, spammers who then use the Haebas headers will become liable for damages under copyright and trademark law! From our point of view, this could mean fewer &quot;false positives&quot; or messages bounced by over-strict DNSBLs. They have <a href="http://www.habeas.com/support/sendmail-in.htm">instructions for configuring sendmail to skip DNSBL checks</a> for mail with Haebas headers. I'm planning on running through those; I will put up the results.

	Gerald Waugh posted a link to <a href="http://linux-sxs.org/sendmail_antispam.html">Linux Step-by-step which describes reinstalling sendmail</a> (!) with a lot of spam post-processing goodies built in. Interesting if you don't mind going off the Cobalt upgrade path (if there is such a thing), but we haven't parsed the whole thing yet.
