<h1>Alternatives</h1>
<h2>You always have other options.</h2>
<p>The two-tier defense system described here, using block-lists and procmail, 
 has worked well for me. However, there are other techniques and technologies 
 available for use in place of (or in combination with) what I've described here.</p>
<h2>Malicious-code scanning</h2>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/mimedefang/">MIMEDefang</a> is a sendmail 
  &quot;milter&quot; which moves much of the work of The Sanitizer up to the sendmail 
  level.</li>
 <li><a href="http://mailtools.anomy.net/">Anomy Mail Tools</a> is another Sanitizer.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.amavis.org/">Amavis</a> is a mail virus scanner.</li>
 <li>Steve Bassi wrote <a href="http://www.raqateers.com/">packages</a> to install 
  <a href="http://www.sng.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mailscanner/">mailscanner</a> (free) 
  and <a href="http://www.f-prot.com">F-Prot</a> (license required, check the 
  site).</li>
 <li>Joe Quinn detailed <a href="http://www.qitc.net/support/mailscanner/">his 
  experiences installing Mailscanner and SpamAssassin</a> on a RaQ4. Very well 
  done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spam blocking</h2>
<h3>Whitelists</h3>
<p> &quot;Whitelisting&quot; and &quot;greenlisting&quot; are methods of spam 
 filtering which involve, in a nutshell, accepting mail from &quot;known good&quot; 
 senders, and subjecting only unknown senders to intense filtering, perhaps even 
 involving a challenge-and-response system to allow the sender to get themselves 
 on the &quot;known good&quot; list. This is based on the idea that spammers will 
 not bother to respond to the challenges. Nancy McGough, who wrote the excellent 
 <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/">procmail quick start</a>, 
 has <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/messaging/spam/">a good explanation of 
 this approach to spam-blocking</a>, including links to some of the notable arguments 
 against it (which can be summarized by the names sometimes applied to the challenge-and-response 
 system, &quot;Prove that you love me&quot; or &quot;jump through my hoops.&quot;)</p>
<p>These systems can be custom-built in procmail, if you're patient enough and 
 ready to do a lot of reading in <a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/">the 
 archives of the procmail list</a>. SpamAssassin will also do whitelisting, if 
 you configure it properly. There are other pre-built systems which will do this:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.tmda.net/">TMDA</a> - Tagged Mail Delivery Agent. There's 
  a VERY good explanation of how this works and what it does on the home page.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.johncon.com/john/Cmd/">CMD</a> - Confirmed Mail Delivery, 
  a package by John Conover.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.habeas.com/">Habeas</a> - A sort of institutionalized 
  white list. They explain it better than I do.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General reading</h3>
<p>You'll do better administering your spam and anti-virus defenses if you have 
 a better understanding of what they do, and what you're up against.</p>
