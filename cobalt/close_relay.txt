Close your open relay:The first thing to do is to look in the GUI. Under "Email Services," click "email servers," then click the "advanced" tab.The two sections you're most interested in are "POP Authenticated Relaying" and "Relay Email From Hosts/Domains/IP Addresses (Optional)".I suggest NOT having "POP Authenticated Relay" checked. Unless you have heavy mail use by many users remote from your Qube, it's not necessary. Instead, put a list of domains/subnets in the "Relay Email From" box, and make it as short as possible. In our case, we only list our domain and our subnet (for a subnet with mask 255.255.255.0, leave a 0 at the end of the IP, like xx.yyy.zz.0 where xx.yyy.zz are the first three octets in your subnet addresses.) Note: remote users can still GET mail via POP and SEND mail via webmail. Also, if you've only got three or four remote email users, you can put their addresses in the list; try to get as narrow an IP range as you can.Remember to click "save" at the bottom of the page when you've made the changes.This SHOULD stop your open relay. For confirmation, see <http://www.mail-abuse.org/tsi/ar-test.html> to test if your site is still relaying; you will need to telnet to relay-test.mail-abuse.org, which will then test your system for relaying and report on what works (or doesn't work.)If this doesn't work, you're going to need to step off Cobalt's GUI and start mucking about in the shell. Sun will happily rent you a consultant to do this work at an absurd hourly rate, or I'll do it at a slightly less absurd rate but still more than you want to pay. (The rate will be adjusted to exceed what you're willing to pay, whatever that is, 'cause I'm not worth it. :-) You're going to be manually changing configuration files, which Sun Cobalt discourages, so continue at your own risk (or expense). First, visit <http://www.sendmail.org/tips/relaying.html>. This details how to configure sendmail to close your relay. If you've followed the steps above to limit relaying, most of the first part of the page won't be needed; scroll down to the part headed, "The Access Database." The file you're working with is /etc/mail/access. Before you do anything, back up this file! You'll need to be logged in via SSH or Telnet. To become root, give the command "su" and put in the root password for your system. Cd to /etc/mail and back up access by giving the command "cp access access.date" (or something like that; I use the date to let me know when I created a particular backup.)Now open access in your favorite text editor. You'll see a cluster of entries at the top which are generated by the Cobalt GUI; hopefully you'll ## /etc/mail/access## This file is automatically generated# Please put custom changes at the end# Cobalt Networks 1999# Put custom additions below (Do not change/remove this line).# Cobalt Access Section Begin11.11.111.50    RELAY10.6.18 RELAYsubdomain.domain.com    RELAYdomain.com     RELAY# Cobalt Access Section End
