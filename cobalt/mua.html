<h1>Filtering SpamAssassin tags in the MUA</h1>
<h2>For Pegasus Mail and Outlook</h2>
<p>Most Mail User Agents now include some sort of mechanism for filtering email 
 based on strings in the header or body of incoming email. I wrote the following 
 Howto for users in our office using Pegasus Mail for Windows or Outlook for Windows, 
 so they could filter out spam which had been tagged by our <a href="procmail.html">installation 
 of SpamAssassin</a>.</p>
<h2>In Pegasus:</h2>
<p> I ran through this in Pegasus 4.</p>
<ul>
 <li> Under the &quot;Tools&quot; menu, select the &quot;Mail Filtering Rules&quot; 
  sub-menu. In the sub-menu, select the &quot;Edit new mail filtering rules&quot; 
  sub-sub-menu (don't get me started on this user interface) and finally the &quot;Rules 
  Applied When A Folder Is Opened&quot; menu item.</li>
 <li>This opens a new window which is probably blank.</li>
 <li> Click the &quot;add rule&quot; button.</li>
 <li> In the menu that pops up, click the &quot;Headers&quot; button at the very 
  top.</li>
 <li> Check the box next to &quot;Subject&quot;, and in the &quot;Contains this 
  text&quot; box underneath, fill in: 
  <ul>
   <li> *****SPAM***** (That's five asterisks.)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> Then select the action &quot;Delete&quot; in the menu under &quot;Then do 
  this:&quot;.</li>
 <li> Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Delete&quot; moves the message to your Deleted Items folder, and the 
 message is probably going to be deleted when you close Pegasus. If you're not 
 confident that everything thus tagged is actually spam, select &quot;Move&quot; 
 under the &quot;Then do this:&quot; menu, and select a folder to route it all 
 in to; you can then check the folder now and then for the falsely accused. </p>
<h2> In Outlook:</h2>
<p> I walked through this in Outlook XP.</p>
<ul style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000;">
 <li> Under the &quot;tools&quot; menu, click &quot;Rules Wizard.&quot;</li>
 <li> Click the button which says, &quot;New...&quot;</li>
 <li> Select the &quot;Start from a blank rule&quot; option, and select &quot;Check 
  messages when they arrive.&quot; Click Next.</li>
 <li> Check &quot;With specific words in the subject,&quot; then click the underlined 
  phrase &quot;specific words&quot; in the &quot;Rule Description&quot; box. (Again, 
  don't get me started about this user interface.)</li>
 <li> In the resulting box, fill in &quot;*****SPAM*****&quot; (five asterisks, 
  don't use the quotes) and click the &quot;Add&quot; button. Then click &quot;OK&quot; 
  to return to the first box,</li>
 <li> and click &quot;Next&quot; there.</li>
 <li> Check &quot;delete it&quot; in the next window. Click Next.</li>
 <li> In the next window, scroll down and check &quot;Except if sender is in specified 
  address book.&quot; In the lower window, click &quot;specified&quot; (yuck) 
  and pick &quot;Outlook Address Book&quot; in the resulting window. (This means 
  Outlook won't trash a message which appears to come from someone in your address 
  book.) Click &quot;OK&quot; to return to the main wizard. Click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
 <li> In the next window, check &quot;Turn this rule on immediately,&quot; and 
  click &quot;Finish&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot; to finish with the Rules window.</li>
</ul>
