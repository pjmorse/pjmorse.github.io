I learned a bunch of games, some very basic BASIC (I   managed some I/O and conditionals, but never managed flow control or functions)   some spreadsheets (VisiCalc) and word processing - not bad on a system not equipped   to display lower case characters in most programs. That got me to college essays.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/">college</a> I got a <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_lc/stats/mac_lc_ii.html">Mac LC II</a>, one of   the systems built when <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> was actively   trying to get American consumers to buy Windows. Still, it got me to the next   most important step: the college VAX, a VMS system allowing basic internet functions   like email, finger, and talk. That was enough, a starter drug that led me within   a semester to our unix system, Usenet, and eventually, in 1994, the Web. I think   that's when I really became <a href="/geek.html">a geek</a>. I worked for the   Academic Computer Center for three years as a Supervisor, taking a three-hour   shift weekly (sometimes more) answering everyone else's questions, which taught   me even more about computers, including how people interact with them (and how   they can screw them up).</p><p>I launched my college home page in January 1995. Between then and graduation,   I worked on a number of sites at the college, sometimes for pay, sometimes not.   I managed to work that into an internship at <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com">Runner's   World</a>, which eventually became full-time. Through August 2001, I worked   as Online Editor (i.e. internet gnome) for RW. In addition to the main site,   my office (there ended up being three of us - another alum is now at <a href="http://www.nikerunning.com">nikerunning.com</a>)   maintained the <a href="http://www.highschoolrunner.com">High School Runner   site</a>, the <a href="http://www.newrunner.com">New Runner website</a>, and   the <a href="http://www.womens-running.com">Women's Running site</a>. I kept   working with Macs, did more with Windows, and learned multiple tools for website   tweaking - <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">BBEdit</a>,   <a href="http://www.regexp.org/">regexps</a>, and more (of course).</p><p>In September of 2001, I left RW and started work at <a href="http://www.sinauer.com">Sinauer   Associates</a> as &quot;media coordinator&quot; (or something like that.) I   do websites, CD-ROMS, systems and network administration, and help desk for   both our office and for all users of our software. I've learned more than I   expected possible about a lot of academia. You can find more details about my   work there <a href="http://bluebird.sinauer.com/~morse/">on my Sinauer page</a>.   Aside from having to learn the tools to run our server, I've had to do more   Perl and now <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>.</p><p>I only took about two courses in <a href="http://www.cs.amherst.edu/">Computer   Science</a> in college, because a perceived difficulty with math led me out   of that path. Some years later, I decided I needed a more solid background geeking.   I have ambitions to an advanced degree, but I started out at the <a href="http://www.muhlenberg.edu/wescoe/">Muhlenberg   Evening College</a>, and now I take night classes at <a href="http://www.wsc.ma.edu/dgce/">Westfield   State College</a>, working towards a &quot;second bachelors&quot; or something   like it. I've gotten in to <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">databases</a>, networking,   more calculus, organization and architecture, systems programming...</p><p>Working doesn't always mean computers. You'll find a collection of links to   articles I've written about running on <a href="/clips.php">my clips page</a>.   Since leaving RW, I've also had articles in three New York Road Runners' sites,   <i>New England Runner</i>, and <i>Running Times</i>.</p>  <p><a href="/resume/home.html">There's more past work</a>, which you'll find <a href="/resume/home.html">in   my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>. In all the time I've been doing this, I've had   my fingers on a fair number of sites, but on most of them, my fingerprints have   since been smudged.</p>  <p><a href="/about.html">about this site</a> </p>	</body></html>
