Hence the name. It's not a business, and I won't   try to sell you anything here, so no .com.</p>  <p> But I'm not a non-profit either, so no .org.</p>  <p>It's a place for people to find out just who I am. At least as much as I     want to tell them, of course.</p>  <p>So to start with, you get the resume. And links to work I've done, projects   I've had a part in. That's for potential employers to find out who I am.</p>  <p>That's not the whole story, of course. Maybe there's more. You figure it out.   Follow the links. Put the pieces together. No fun without a challenge, right?</p>  <p>It's also a place for me. A workshop, if you will, where I can try out new     things, learn how to make them work. Internet projects, hence the .net.</p>  <p>So, a word of warning. You may find stuff unplugged, tools not put away in   the right places, pieces without the edges filed down. In a perfect world it   would be the kind of work I do when I'm working - alt tags on everything, clean   code, clean styles, no broken links, portable, etc. etc.</p>  <p>But if it was a finished project, I'd have it somewhere else, nyet?</p><p>This site was <a href="http://www.apple.com">Made with a Macintosh</a>.
